# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation and potential enhancements for the simple_proxy project. The project is a dual-write reverse proxy built with Pingora that forwards HTTP requests to two backend services simultaneously, enabling scenarios like data migration validation, primary-backup consistency checks, and disaster recovery testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating this project, I want comprehensive documentation that explains the architecture, functionality, and usage patterns, so that I can quickly understand how to implement and extend the proxy for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the README THEN they SHALL understand the core dual-write proxy concept and its benefits
2. WHEN a developer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL see detailed API endpoints and request/response examples for both backend services
3. WHEN a developer examines the architecture section THEN they SHALL understand how Pingora handles the dual-write mechanism
4. IF a developer wants to extend the proxy THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear extension points and customization examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying this proxy, I want detailed configuration options and deployment instructions, so that I can properly configure and monitor the proxy in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator reviews deployment instructions THEN they SHALL see configuration options for ports, backend endpoints, and logging levels
2. WHEN an administrator sets up monitoring THEN they SHALL have access to health check endpoints and metrics information
3. WHEN an administrator encounters issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guides and common error scenarios
4. IF an administrator needs to scale the deployment THEN they SHALL see performance considerations and scaling guidelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the backend services, I want complete API documentation with examples, so that I can understand all available endpoints and their expected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reviews the API documentation THEN they SHALL see all CRUD operations for user management
2. WHEN a developer tests endpoints THEN they SHALL have curl examples for each operation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. WHEN a developer examines data models THEN they SHALL understand the User structure and validation rules
4. IF a developer needs authentication details THEN they SHALL see password hashing implementation using Argon2

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer implementing dual-write scenarios, I want detailed examples and use cases, so that I can understand when and how to apply this pattern effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads use case examples THEN they SHALL see practical scenarios like database migration and A/B testing
2. WHEN a developer examines the dual-write implementation THEN they SHALL understand how request deduplication works
3. WHEN a developer reviews error handling THEN they SHALL see how failures in secondary backend are managed
4. IF a developer needs to customize dual-write behavior THEN they SHALL see extension points and configuration options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want comprehensive development setup instructions and testing guidelines, so that I can effectively contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer sets up the development environment THEN they SHALL have step-by-step instructions for all dependencies
2. WHEN a developer runs tests THEN they SHALL see comprehensive test coverage for both proxy and backend services
3. WHEN a developer examines code structure THEN they SHALL understand the separation between proxy logic and backend services
4. IF a developer wants to add features THEN they SHALL see contribution guidelines and code standards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user comparing this solution with alternatives, I want performance benchmarks and comparison data, so that I can make informed decisions about adopting this proxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reviews performance data THEN they SHALL see latency and throughput metrics for the dual-write proxy
2. WHEN a user compares alternatives THEN they SHALL see advantages of using Pingora over other proxy solutions
3. WHEN a user evaluates resource usage THEN they SHALL see memory and CPU consumption patterns
4. IF a user needs scalability information THEN they SHALL see concurrent connection handling capabilities
